# Snapquanow Demo

This is a demo of the [Snapquanow Snap](https://github.com/ziad-saab/snapquanow). The Snapquanow snap exposes market data from Aquanow in a one-time or streaming fashion, but doesn't itself have any UI. This repo contains a minimal UI for interacting with the Snapquanow Snap.

## Running the UI

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn install` from the repo's directory
3. Run `yarn serve`
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8888/
